# Event-Loop-JDK21
This project is an implementation of an asynchronous task execution system based on the Event Loop model, similar to the one used in JavaScript, but adapted to a Java environment. This system manages tasks, timers, and promises efficiently in a single thread, handling I/O tasks and timers with an approach based on a CallStack, TaskQueue, and MicrotaskQueue.
